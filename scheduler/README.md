Scheduler
-
Having difficulty from manually finding a way to suit all of my courses into a timetable, 
I created a scheduler to automatically build timetable to take all of my possible courses without collapsing.

The method is:
1. From the given course list in excel file, the program finds the possible schedule
2. Shows a list of schedules if there are more than one match, so the user can decide his best fit
3. Imports an error if there is a collapsing course, but with best match of schedule possible


Can we do better?
