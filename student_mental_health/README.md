Data set was collected by a survey conducted by Google forms from University student, total 50 responses are recorded to examine their academic situation and mental health.
The first 'student_mh' table has 10 columns and 50 rows in total which contains the data set from the survey.
To correlate the connection between academic situation and mental health, I created another 'binary' table which counts the positive responses of depression, anxiety and panic attack.

Joining two related tables, it has the first query table that relates gpa and mental health.
People with gpa bound of 2.0 - 2.49 has showed none of positive answer to experiencing mental illness while students with cgpa 3.50 - 4.00 answered the highest ratio of positive response to anxiety and panic attack.
According to that, students with high GPA has more tendency to go through mental illness.

Corresponding to gender, female students answered positive almost more than twice as much as male students did, especially regarding depression.
Therefore, female students go through more depression, anxiety and panic attack.

Relating to the current year of study, relatively lower grade, year 1 and 2 answered most of the positive responses.
Accodingly, lower grades feel more stress than higher grades.
